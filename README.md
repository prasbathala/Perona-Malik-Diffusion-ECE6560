#  Perona-Malik Anisotropic Diffusion



## ECE 6560 Project V1

Partial Differential Equations for Computer Vision

This project deals with the application of Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion to a 2D image.

This repository includes :

- A report
- Images in "image" folder
- Source code 


## Run

This project is based on **Python 3.7** and below libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- skimage
- PIL
- imageio
- math

All libraries are the latest versions by April 2020.

Make sure you have the target image under "image" folder and its name stand with the parameter in "main.py".

To run:
- Python<main.py> log

The result image will be saved in image folder and console output will be save to "log".
